#+TITLE: Use structs for errors

* Atoms and tagged tuples are cool, until they aren't
- Where did that atom come from?
- Stacktraces are so much better
* Exceptions? Are you really doing Elixir?
- Rescue and raise aren't as nice as ~with~
- Throws are for control flow, not for exception handling
- Exceptions are for exceptional things. What are your invariants?
* What about mixing both?
- Rust approach with each module having their own errors
- Maybe mention [[https://github.com/expede/exceptional][Exceptional]] to show that exception is just a behaviour
- Include metadata in your error structs to reduce the different size problem
