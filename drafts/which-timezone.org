#+title: Selecting Timezone

* What timezone should you use? User's or UTC?
* Should we only show or also filter using a user timezone?
* Is it the job of frontend or backend to care about timezones?
** If it's the frontend, what about queries such as "last 7 days"?
- If the backend starts at current UTC and do a minus 7, then it's the same timespan for both
- What happens if it goes back to the start of the current day? Then it's not the same 7 days anymore

* Scratchpad

- You can use a ~AT TIME ZONE~ in Postgres to convert it when querying. Ecto fragment: ~fragment("? AT TIME ZONE ?", todo.inserted_at, ^timezone)~
